# Final_Project_Sagemaker

To run the code, you don't have to download anything manually.
Just git clone it on your sagemaker studio using the repository link : "https://github.com/GaldLeduc/Final_Project_Sagemaker.git"
Then :
- Run Data_Cleaning.ipynb and wait for everything to be executed
- Run Train&Deploy.ipynb and wait for it to be fully executed

As the names suggest, the first notebook will download the dataset we want to use (MS_Marco), clean it and Transform it so that it will be usable for the model.
The second one will import the dataset and after tokenization, the dataset will be used to train the model.
